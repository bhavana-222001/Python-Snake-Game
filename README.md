# Python-Snake-Game

Overview
This is a classic Snake Game developed in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game allows players to control a snake using arrow keys, growing in length and increasing the score upon eating food, with collision detection for walls and the snake's body. Built in PyCharm on Windows 10, it demonstrates core programming skills and game design concepts.

Features
Interactive Gameplay: Control the snake using arrow keys to navigate and eat food.
Dynamic Growth: Snake grows longer with each food consumed, increasing the score.
Collision Detection: Detects collisions with walls and the snake's body to end the game.
OOP Design: Modular code structure using classes for snake, food, and game logic.
Simple Interface: Clean and intuitive game environment for an engaging experience.

Installation
